<p>Being a good developer is far away from just having technical skills or knowing well the language you code. In my career working with companies, I saw people starting from zero becoming the best developers on the team, and also senior developers become useless. But what did happen to this people? How can a junior become an expert and those who are considered experts become outdated?</p>

<p>There are some things I want to share with you. Some of them I learned from others, and the other ones are from self-experience.</p>

<h1 id="1-be-versatile">1. Be versatile</h1>

<p>A few days ago I was having a conversation with a client of mine - he hired me to improve the performance of an algorithm that he made - and he was telling me how hard is being this change for him.</p>

<p>He is a former DBA of a great company. As things were moving on and all the systems of his company were migrating to the cloud, he found himself in a tough place. There were two choices left: learn software development or get fired.  Yes, he chose the first option. But, can you imagine how hard is for someone who spent the last ten years dealing with databases start learning JavaScript, Python and so on?</p>

<p>Here is one of the most important lessons I ever learned: don&rsquo;t freeze in just one technology. The world is changing fast and knowing how to do only one thing will make you useless. You can&rsquo;t get stuck in one language, one framework, one job function, etc.</p>

<p>Sure you need to focus your career on something, but it can&rsquo;t close your mind about the other things out there. In my last job, I worked on absolutely everything. Since front-end to deployment and data processing automation. I acquired a lot of experience and still didn&rsquo;t lose my focus on learning big data and machine learning.</p>

<p>By the way, if you want to learn about big data prepare yourself to be using a bunch of tools. You&rsquo;ll need to know about Spark, Kafka, Hadoop, Hive, SQL and so on.</p>

<h1 id="2-keep-improving-yourself">2. Keep improving yourself</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>The key to being a good developer is to realize that nobody is a good developer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Software development as any other thing you do in life is all about practice. The more you code, more you improve your logic and problem-solving skills. Don&rsquo;t think your algorithm will be up and running at the first build. Always be prepared for errors, they will ever come to you.</p>

<p>Everyone has a different learning curve. Perhaps you feel like you&rsquo;re not good enough and trust me: no one is. You need to keep improving yourself as long as you can, that&rsquo;s the secret.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t give up if the concepts are hard to understand. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if something goes wrong. Just give it another try.</p>

<h1 id="3-always-have-a-side-project">3. Always have a side project</h1>

<p>As I said before: development is about practice. So, if you want to master a skill you need to apply it to the real world. By having a side project, you can implement what you&rsquo;re learning and get used to it.</p>

<p>You can build any application you have in mind, or even run some code experiments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anything you do is better than doing nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember that one time ago when I wanted to learn Java. I started to create every solution I could. An app to inventory management, another one to remember me to drink water, another one to wake me up. I don&rsquo;t use java nowadays, but it gave me a great background to use with other languages.</p>

<p>Think about something, doesn&rsquo;t matter if it already exists, and do it. You have nothing to lose.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Keep your side projects public on Github. Share with people what you&rsquo;re doing, it helps you to keep motivated. One more plus about this is that companies can find you through your work.</p>

<h1 id="4-have-no-fear">4. Have no fear</h1>

<p>It is hard for new developers to get the confidence to apply for a job. You can think that you don&rsquo;t have enough experience, or your skillset doesn&rsquo;t match the requirements. But let me tell you a little secret: companies have the bad habit of asking for more than they need.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re applying for a job, don&rsquo;t be afraid if you don&rsquo;t fill all the requirements. Go for it, besides there&rsquo;s nothing you can&rsquo;t learn.</p>

<p>The same goes for those who already have a job. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to learn new things, or asking about something that you don&rsquo;t know. Remember that your work is not just about programming, but also learning, researching, etc. It&rsquo;s better to ask now than at the end of a deadline when you can&rsquo;t go further with your task.</p>

<p>If the people working around can&rsquo;t teach or help you, get out of this place. You&rsquo;ll be better unemployed than surrounded by knowledge keepers.</p>

<h1 id="5-take-care-of-your-health">5. Take care of your health</h1>

<p>Believe me: we all need this - yes, including myself.</p>

<p>We have the habit of caring for our health when it&rsquo;s too late. Go to a doctor and do a checkup. Change your eating habits and do exercises. I don&rsquo;t need to put numbers here to tell you how people are sedentary nowadays.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Get out of this computer and go for a walk, now!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can&rsquo;t just keep seated all day long. Your body was made to move. Go to the gym, learn martial arts, bike to work.  Also, try to sleep better. A well-rested body can do much more. Your brain will thank you for that.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope you become a better developer after reading this post. There are much more things that you help you, but I think these are the best tips I learned so far.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, don&rsquo;t forget to follow me on social media. I wish you all the greatness of the world.</p>
