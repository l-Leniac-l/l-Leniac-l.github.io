Hey there, that's me.

It's a little hard to talk about myself, but i will give it a try.

I'm a 23 years old developer living in Brazil and working for an amazing company called [1STi](http://www.1sti.com.br/).

I have been an enthusiast my entire life and i love discovering new stuff and talk about that.

This website is a place where i will talk about anything in my mind, or anything that i work with, so you'll se a lot of subjects here 
like: Deep Learning, Big Data, DevOps and Continuous Delivery, General programming and anything else you can think about.

That's it. I'm glad you're here!
