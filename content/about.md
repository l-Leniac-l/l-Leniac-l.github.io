Hi there, that's me.

I'm a 23 years old developer living in Brazil.

I have been an enthusiast my entire life and I love discover and share new things.

In this website I will talk about anything in my mind, or anything that I'm working on, so you'll read about everything here.

That's it. I'm glad you're here!
