Being a good developer is far away from just having technical skills or knowing well the language you code. In my career working with companies, I saw people starting from zero becoming the best developers on the team, and also senior developers become useless. But what did happen to this people? How can a junior become an expert and those who are considered experts become outdated?

There are some things I want to share with you. Some of them I learned from others, and the other ones are from self-experience.

## 1. Be versatile
A few days ago I was having a conversation with a client of mine - he hired me to improve the performance of an algorithm that he made - and he was telling me how hard is being this change for him.

He is a former DBA of a great company. As things were moving on and all the systems of this company were migrating to the cloud, he found himself in a tough place. There were two choices left: learn software development or get fired.  Yes, he chose the first option. But, can you imagine how hard is for someone who spent the last ten years dealing with databases start learning JavaScript, Python and so on?

Here is one of the most important lessons I ever learned: don't freeze in just one technology. The world is changing fast and knowing how to do only one thing will make you useless. You can't get stuck in one language, one framework, one job function, etc.

Sure you need to focus your career on something, but it can't close your mind about the other things out there. In my last job, I worked on absolutely everything. Since front-end to deployment and data processing automation. My older co-workers used to call me god, I was everywhere doing everything. I acquired a lot of experience and didn't lose my focus on learning big data and machine learning.
