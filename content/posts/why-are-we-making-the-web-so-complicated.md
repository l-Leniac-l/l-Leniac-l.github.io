Iâ€™ve been a web developer for almost 6 years including the time spent studying and making 
personal projects while looking for a real job. In this time I've been made it through some 
great challenges like building a budget system, a CRM to getting in touch with 2 million 
clients and some more great projects.

After working with the most popular frameworks out there for building Single Page Applications, 
I think we are making the web much more complicated than it should be.

Look, I understand the need to use Web Components nowadays, and I couldn't live without them. 
I can say the same about state management. But are these solutions making our lives easier? 
I don't think so.

The web was made to be simple, HTML to be readable and CSS to just style it.
